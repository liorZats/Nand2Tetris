# Nand2Tetris - Project 04: Machine Language
## Project Overview
In this project, I wrote several programs in Hack machine language, a simple assembly-like language designed for the Hack computer architecture built in previous projects.
The programs demonstrate basic control flow, computation, and memory manipulation at the machine level.

# Implemented Programs
The following Hack machine language programs were written and tested:

Mult: Multiplies two positive integers using iterative addition.

Fill: Continuously reads the keyboard and fills the screen with either white or black, depending on whether a key is pressed.

Rect: Draws a rectangle on the screen based on user input.

Each program was implemented by directly writing binary instructions in the Hack machine language.

## How to Run
1. Download the Nand2Tetris software suite from here.

2. Open the CPU Emulator.

3. Load each .hack file into the emulator.

4. Run the program step-by-step or continuously to observe memory changes and screen output.
