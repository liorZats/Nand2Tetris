# Nand2Tetris - Project 01: Boolean Logic
## Project Overview
In this project, I implemented the fundamental building blocks of digital circuits using HDL (Hardware Description Language). Starting from the Nand gate, I constructed all basic Boolean logic gates that serve as the foundation for more complex hardware components.
