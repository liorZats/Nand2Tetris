# Nand2Tetris - Project 02: Boolean Arithmetic
## Project Overview
In this stage, I built essential arithmetic components that can perform basic mathematical operations on binary data. These components are crucial for creating the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in later projects.

## Implemented Components
The following arithmetic chips were implemented:

HalfAdder: Computes the sum and carry of two bits.

FullAdder: Computes the sum and carry of three bits.

Add16: Adds two 16-bit binary numbers.

Inc16: Increments a 16-bit binary number by one.

ALU: A simple Arithmetic Logic Unit that performs multiple operations (addition, bitwise AND, negation, etc.) based on control bits.

Each component was built using previously designed logic gates from Project 01, maintaining the bottom-up construction approach.
