# Nand2Tetris - Project 05: Computer Architecture
This project is part of the Nand2Tetris course and focuses on constructing a general-purpose 16-bit computer from the ground up.

## Project Overview
In this project, I designed and built the Hack Computer by integrating the hardware components developed in previous projects.
The computer is capable of fetching, decoding, and executing instructions written in Hack machine language.

The Hack computer consists of:

An Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

A CPU (Central Processing Unit)

A Memory system (RAM and Program Counter)

Input/Output interfaces (Screen and Keyboard)

## How to Run
1. Download the Nand2Tetris software suite from here.

2. Open the Hardware Simulator.

3. Load each .tst file to test the corresponding component.

4. To test the full computer, load the Computer.tst file and run machine language programs such as Mult.hack, Fill.hack, or Rect.hack from Project 04.
